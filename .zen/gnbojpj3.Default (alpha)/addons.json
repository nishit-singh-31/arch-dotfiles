(Reduces traffic and prevents your IP from being listed in the server logs. Therefore a small offline help page is also integrated.)\n\nFor clarification: This extension doesn't create an external connection by itself. LocalCDN contains these frameworks/libraries in add-on storage. This is the reason why the size of LocalCDN is 17 MB. There is also a donation page and a short FAQ page inside the extension. There are only external connections in the form of hyperlinks that the user must actively click on. This includes, for example, the test page or the translation platform \"Weblate\". All links are marked.\n\n---\n\nThis add-on is a fork of https://git.synz.io/Synzvato/decentraleyes","weeklyDownloads":557,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"nobody","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/15698979/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/271/271246.png?modified=1657374986","width":350,"height":281,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/271/271246.jpg?modified=1657374986","thumbnailWidth":350,"thumbnailHeight":281,"caption":"Clean website without 3rd party scripts (LocalCDN: enabled.
